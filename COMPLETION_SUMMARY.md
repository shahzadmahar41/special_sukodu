```

**Key Observations:**

- All boards solved within seconds
- Performance inversely correlates with given clues (good!)
- High failure rates indicate search space exploration
- Algorithm effectiveness improves with better constraint propagation

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Algorithm Components

**1. Backtracking Search**

- Explores solution space systematically
- Prunes branches with constraint violations
- Returns solution when complete assignment found

**2. Constraint Checking**

- Row constraint verification
- Column constraint verification
- 3×3 box constraint verification
- Early termination on invalid assignments

**3. Possibility Enumeration**

- Generates valid candidates for each cell
- Returns existing value if pre-filled
- Returns all valid 1-9 values for empty cells

**4. Statistics Tracking**

- Counts total backtrack calls
- Counts failure/restart occurrences
- Enables performance analysis

## 🎯 ALGORITHM ANALYSIS

### Time Complexity

- **Worst Case:** O(9^m) where m = number of empty cells
- **Best Case:** O(n²) where n = 9 (already solved)
- **Average Case:** Highly dependent on puzzle structure

### Space Complexity

- **Board Storage:** O(81) = O(1)
- **Recursion Stack:** O(m) maximum depth
- **Total:** O(m) where m ≤ 81

### Optimization Opportunities

1. AC-3 Algorithm for arc consistency
2. Forward checking for early constraint detection
3. MRV (Minimum Remaining Values) heuristic
4. Naked singles and hidden singles techniques

## 📊 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### Difficulty vs. Performance

Interestingly, the algorithm shows:

- Not always harder with fewer clues
- Very hard board: lowest backtrack calls (1,702)
- Medium board: highest backtrack calls (4,209)

**Explanation:** Puzzle structure matters more than clue count. Some highly constrained puzzles are easier to navigate than moderately constrained ones.

### Failure Rate Pattern

- Easy: 78.2% - Most moves lead to valid solution branch
- Medium: 98.8% - Frequent dead ends, extensive backtracking
- Hard: 98.2% - Similar backtracking intensity to medium
- Very Hard: 96.2% - Slightly better efficiency despite fewer clues
